# Dependencies: copy, tkinter, xlrd

# Parses an Excel file with program sequencing information (when courses are taken)
# and returns a dictionary storing the program plan name as key (Traditional, Co-op plan 1, etc.)
# and a dict as value. This inner dict has the term name (Term 1, Term 2, etc.) as key
# and a list of Course objects as value.
#
# Parameters:
#   course_obj_dict (dictionary): dict with course name for key and 
#   Course class as value. Course class described in parsing.py
#   filename (string): Name of the Excel file to be parsed for sequencing
#   info. Format described in README. Can only be a .xls file (NOT .xlsx)
#
# Returns:
#   course_seq (dictionary): Key is plan name, value is another dict with 
#   term name as the key and a list of the Course objects taken in that term as value.
